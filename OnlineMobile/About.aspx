        iPhone is a pocket camera, computer, and yes — communicator — all in one. It's Apple's most successful product and one of the most successful products of all time. Introduced by Steve Jobs in 2007, Apple has sold over a billion of them to date. Current models include iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone SE. That's a lot of iPhones, with a lot of different features, at a lot of different price points.
Buying your iPhone
If you haven't gotten an iPhone yet or you're looking to upgrade to a new iPhone, you have a lot to choose from. Apple not only sells the all-new iPhone X, but the updated iPhone 8, last year's iPhone 7, the lower-priced iPhone 6s, and the compact iPhone SE. If you're not sure which model is for you, or what color or capacity, or whether you should get AppleCare or not, here's everything you need to help you decide.
Using your iPhone
Once you have your new iPhone, you're going to want to set it up and get started using it. You can either set it up as a new phone, restore it from the backup of a previous iPhone, or move your data over from an old Android phone, Windows phone, or BlackBerry. Then the fun starts — everything in iOS is now available to you, from iMessage to the Camera, Apple Pay to the Safari web browser, Home automation to Health and fitness.
